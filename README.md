üìñ About The Project

AudioSeal is a web-based tool that provides a user-friendly interface for digital steganography in audio files. It allows you to embed a secret text message into an audio file (like .wav, .mp3, or .flac) and then extract it later. This project demonstrates core concepts of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) wrapped in a modern, responsive web application with a sleek "glassmorphism" design.

The core of the application uses a Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm to subtly alter the audio data in a way that is imperceptible to the human ear but can be detected by the software.

‚ú® Key Features

Embed Watermark: Hide any text message within a supported audio file.

Detect Watermark: Extract the hidden message from a sealed audio file.

Drag & Drop Interface: Modern, easy-to-use file upload system.

Multi-Format Support: Works with .wav, .mp3, .flac, and other common audio formats thanks to pydub.

Secure & Private: All processing is done on the server, and files are not stored permanently.

Responsive Design: A beautiful UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
